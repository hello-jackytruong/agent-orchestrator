/**
 * The Chat composer.
 *
 * Submitting is a typed send, not a keystroke: there is no notion of "press
 * Enter at the agent" here, and an empty message is never a way to nudge it.
 *
 * A message typed mid-turn is held by the daemon and sent when the turn ends,
 * because the agent is one conversation and cannot run a second turn alongside
 * the first. The placeholder says so rather than leaving the user to guess where
 * their text went, and the queued message stays visible only in the dock.
 *
 * The model, reasoning effort and approval controls belong here rather than in
 * settings because the provider takes all three per turn: choosing one changes the
 * next message and never restarts the agent.
 *
 * Three completions live in the editor — `/` for AO commands and the agent's own
 * skills, `@` for worktree files, and pasted or dropped files. Completed skills
 * and paths are atomic inline chips but serialize to the plain text the agent
 * expects. The original keyboard contract remains: Enter sends, Shift+Enter makes
 * a newline, and ordinary typing stays local to the editor instead of rerendering
 * the surrounding chat surface.
 *
 * Every affordance is conditional on being able to deliver. The `/` menu only opens
 * when the provider actually reported skills, and the attach control only appears
 * when a caller supplied somewhere to put the bytes — a control that cannot do what
 * it says should not be drawn.
