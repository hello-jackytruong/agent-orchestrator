# Local testing target

`New()` launches the real, unpackaged Electron executable from a prepared
checkout. Electron manages the target Go daemon. Static Forge/Vite assets avoid
extra Vite and HMR listeners. This is not an Electron package or installed app.

## Reuse a warm target

From this worker checkout, run:

```sh
python3 backend/internal/adapters/testingtarget/local/prepare.py --commit <base-sha>
# After the base attempt has completed cleanup:
python3 backend/internal/adapters/testingtarget/local/prepare.py --commit <head-sha>
```

The script removes inherited `AO_*` variables before every subprocess. It
keeps one checkout per repository at `~/.ao/dev/agentic-target/repos/{repo-hash}/checkout`.
Use `--repository <path>` for a different source checkout. It clones once,
then fetches and checks out each exact revision in the same folder. Tracked
edits and an active target reservation prevent preparation. It never runs
`git clean` or deletes `node_modules`. Each package's last installed lockfile
hash is retained beside the checkout; `npm install --prefer-offline` runs
only when that hash changes. Go/npm use the user's normal cache settings.
Only the daemon and Forge/Vite assets needed to launch the app are compiled,
without packaging or repository test/lint suites. Do not symlink dependencies.
The manifest pins the revision and hashes the launch artifacts. Set
`AO_TESTING_TARGET_CHECKOUT` to the printed checkout path for both attempts.

## Slice B wiring

Pass one `TestingTargetSpec` with:

- `AttemptID`: one safe path component, used for a fresh private state directory.
- `Generation`: positive ownership generation.
- `CheckoutPath`: the absolute prepared checkout path under
  `~/.ao/dev/agentic-target/`.
- `CommitSHA`: exact full SHA recorded in `frontend/.vite/testing-target.json`.
- `StateRoot`: empty for the default, or the exact
  `~/.ao/dev/agentic-target/{AttemptID}` path.
- `Deadline`: a future time. Startup also has a three-minute limit.
- `RecipeSnapshot`: JSON. The optional `visualMarker: true` fixture adds a badge.
  Other recipe fields belong to the testing service.

Keep the returned identity even when startup fails so cleanup can be retried.
The adapter keeps ownership in memory and does not reattach after a restart.
Slice D binds a window using `ElectronPID` and its exact kernel start time.
The window identifier is accepted back with the same launch identity.

All inherited `AO_*` values are removed. Owned overrides select fresh data,
run file, Electron profile, loopback port, launch ID and fake harness. Telemetry
is disabled. `AO_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=app://renderer` avoids the dev helper adding
the opaque `null` origin for static assets. Tool callers cannot select a target endpoint or log file.
Readiness checks kernel identities, the run file, `/readyz` executable, startup cwd and live data cwd,
and successful projects and sessions GETs. Log output is bounded and remains
readable after cleanup. ReadLogs reads only captured files and does no process
inventory or PID lookup. It includes optional data/daemon.log and
data/logs/daemon.log sinks, using a cursor per file. The current managed daemon
logs through Electron stdout, so those optional sinks can be absent. No fixture oracle is exposed by either observation port.

## Visual fixture and action

The generated main-process wrapper creates a random `SCREEN-` marker and inserts
a badge outside React after the shell WebContentsView renderer loads. Its private oracle is
`fixture-oracle.json` in the attempt directory. It never logs the marker.
The fixed success log only says that the fixture rendered. The fixture is
opt-in and does not change frontend source. Projects/sessions queries cannot
return DOM text, and `ReadLogs` reads only `target.log`.

A later investigator can click the AO Settings gear and observe the Settings
pane in a new screenshot. Slice E's proof takes one screenshot and sends no
input. This action remains unverified until the later input test.

## Cleanup and proof

`Stop` captures descendants, signals only exact captured process identities,
and checks process absence, native windows, the port and run file. Reused PIDs,
failed observations, surviving processes and foreign run files fail cleanup.
Typed process.ErrNotRunning identifies missing and zombie processes. These
descendants are gone; a bare ESRCH/EIO lookup needs another inventory to confirm
absence. A descendant disappearing before signal delivery is also gone. Events
during inventory are noted in target.log. Live PID reuse still prevents signals.
The Electron main and daemon remain required for every live observation.
Logs and retained evidence remain. After absence checks pass, only the owned
data, Electron profile and fixtures are removed; the checkout and normal
caches remain. A checkout reservation prevents another preparation or launch
from changing live code. No kill-by-name or kill-by-port is used. A stale owned
run file is removed only after other absence checks pass.

Default tests use injected process operations and HTTP transports. The live
proof is opt-in, macOS only, and needs the previously installed Cua Driver:

```sh
python3 - <<'PY'
import os, subprocess
for key in list(os.environ):
    if key.startswith('AO_'):
        del os.environ[key]
os.environ.update(LOCAL_TARGET_LIVE='1', GOFLAGS='-p=2', GOMAXPROCS='2')
subprocess.run(['go', 'test', '-p', '2', '-v', '-run', '^TestLiveTargetProof$',
                '-timeout', '8m', './internal/adapters/testingtarget/local'],
               cwd='backend', check=True)
PY
```

It launches one target, records memory pressure and owned-process RSS, verifies
that the marker is absent from API results and logs, captures exactly one target
window through a private Cua Unix socket, and records cleanup. Inspect that PNG
before claiming the marker is visible. Evidence stays beneath `~/.ao`; copy
requested report artifacts out separately. This proof starts no Cua MCP server.
